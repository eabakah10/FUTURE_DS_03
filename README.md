# FUTURE_DS_03
Task 3 for the Data Science &amp; Analytics Internship at Future Interns (student-feedback-analysis)
# 📊 Student Feedback Analysis

This project analyzes feedback from 1,001 students who rated various aspects of a course or instructor on a scale from 1–10. It uses Python libraries such as `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to uncover key insights and areas for improvement.

---

## 🔍 Summary

- **Highest rated**: *Well versed with the subject* – Avg. score: 7.50
- **Lowest rated**: *Assignment difficulty* – Avg. score: 5.43
- **Key concern**: Communication clarity and presentation delivery
- **Strong positive correlations** between clarity, support, and course recommendation

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- The bar chart illustrates the average student ratings for various indicators of teaching quality. While subject knowledge was rated highly (7.5/10), other areas like assignment difficulty, clarity of explanation, and course structure scored below 6. This suggests a need to improve how content is delivered and supported, even if the instructor is knowledgeable. The chart helped prioritize areas for improvement and guided our recommendations.

## ✅ Recommendations

1. **Maintain strong subject delivery** – This is your top-rated strength.
2. **Improve explanation clarity** – Use analogies, examples, and slower pacing.
3. **Standardize assignment difficulty** – Balance challenge and clarity.
4. **Enhance visual tools** – Upgrade presentation style.
5. **Provide more student support** – Offer more office hours and Q&A time.
6. **Refine course structure** – Organize content to improve flow.
